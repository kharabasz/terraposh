# terraposh

PowerShell wrapper for running Terraform. This module takes advantage of [TF_CLI_ARGS and TF_CLI_ARGS_name](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/environment-variables.html#tf_cli_args-and-tf_cli_args_name) environment variables natively supported by Terraform.

In addition, it will automatically sequence the needed order of operations for commands. As an example, if you use `terraposh plan` or `tpp`, it will automatically sequence the `terraform init` --> `terraform workspace` --> `terraform plan` commands for you.

For [Terraform workspaces](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html), the default behvior of `terraposh` is to use the current `git branch` name as the workspace. You can also manually provide one via the `-Workspace` parameter. If the workspace doesn't exist, it will make it for you. When destroying a state via `terraposh destroy`, `tpd`, or `tpda` the workspace will also be deleted and set back to the `default` workspace.

## Usage examples

```powershell
Import-Module 'terraposh.psd1' -Force
```

- Plan, apply, and destroy commands will all perform a `terraform init` automatically.
- If a workspace is not provided, the current git branch will be used via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
- By default, the working directory will be assumed to be the `Directory`

### terraform plan

- `terraposh plan`
- `tpp`

### terraform apply

- `terraposh apply`
- `tpa`

### terraform destroy

- `terraposh destroy`
- `tpd`
- `tpda` inludes `-auto-approve` and will not prompt for confirmation

## Terraposh configuration

When a `terraposh` command is executed, it will look for a config file. This config file is a JSON file containing the values to populate Terraform CLI environment variables. A default one is provided within the module with empty values. The search order for a config is:

1. `~/.terraposh.config.json`
2. If in a Git repo, it will look for `.terraposh.config.json`, starting at the current directory, or `-Directory`, and going up until it reaches the root of the repo. Files closest to the starting directory will take precedence over one futher up.
3. `-ConfigFile` parameter
4. `TERRAPOSH_CONFIG_JSON` environment variable

Items further down the list take precedence over higher ones, with the environment variable being the highest.

The config file can contain any number of `TF_CLI_ARGS` and they will all be loaded.  An example would be:

```json
{
    "TerraformVersion": "1.6.3",
    "CreateHardLink": true,
    "SkipWorkspace": false,
    "SignatureVerification": "Required",
    "TF_CLI_ARGS_init": "-backend=true -upgrade=true -backend-config=backend.tfvars -reconfigure",
    "TF_CLI_ARGS_plan": "-detailed-exitcode -parallelism=20 -out=.terraform/plan.bin -var-file=development.tfvars",
    "TF_CLI_ARGS_apply": "-parallelism=20 .terraform/plan.bin",
    "TF_CLI_ARGS_destroy": "-parallelism=20 -var-file=development.tfvars",
    "TF_CLI_ARGS_fmt": "-recursive",
    "TF_CLI_ARGS_output": "-json"
}
```

## Terraform binary downloads

Terraform binaries are vendored under `~/.terraposh/vendored`. Pin `TerraformVersion` in each repository's `.terraposh.config.json`; if no version is set, terraposh warns and resolves the latest release.

Downloads are only made over HTTPS from HashiCorp's official release server (`https://releases.hashicorp.com`), with redirects refused. Every archive is cross-checked against HashiCorp's published `terraform_<version>_SHA256SUMS` before it is extracted. A download that fails verification is discarded and the command fails; a cached archive that fails verification is re-downloaded.

### Signature verification

On top of the checksum check, terraposh verifies that the release really comes from HashiCorp:

| OS | Check | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `terraform_<version>_SHA256SUMS` is verified with `gpgv` against HashiCorp's release key (bundled as `hashicorp.asc`, fingerprint `C874 011F 0AB4 0511 0D02  1055 3436 5D94 72D7 468F`) before any checksum is trusted | `gpgv` (preinstalled on most distributions; package `gpgv` or `gnupg`) |
| macOS | The extracted binary must carry a valid Apple Developer ID signature from HashiCorp (team `D38WU7D763`) | nothing (`codesign` is built in) |
| Windows | The extracted binary must carry a valid Authenticode signature from `HashiCorp, Inc.` | nothing (`Get-AuthenticodeSignature` is built in) |

A signature that is present but invalid, from someone else, or missing on Linux always fails the command. What happens when a signature *can't* be checked (no `gpgv` on Linux, or an unsigned binary on macOS/Windows) is controlled by `SignatureVerification` in `.terraposh.config.json` or the `-SignatureVerification` parameter:

- `Auto` (default): warn and continue
- `Required`: fail
- `Off`: skip signature checks (checksums are still verified)

The build matching your OS and CPU architecture is used. On Arm64 macOS and Windows, if a version has no native build (e.g. Terraform < 1.0.2 on Apple Silicon), the `amd64` build is used under emulation (Rosetta 2 on macOS) and a warning is shown.

## Running tests

Tests use [Pester](https://pester.dev) and run in GitHub Actions on Linux, Windows and macOS (amd64 and arm64). To run them locally:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Pester -RequiredVersion 6.2.0 -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-Pester -Path ./tests                                  # all tests
Invoke-Pester -Path ./tests -ExcludeTagFilter Integration    # skip downloading from releases.hashicorp.com
```

## Commands

All functions support the same params.

```powershell
[string]$TerraformCommand # Will be suffixed to command (required only for base terraposh command) via terraform <TerraformCommand>
[string]$ConfigFile       # Terraposh config file path
[string]$Directory        # Directory of Terraform root module code
[string]$Workspace        # Terraform workspace name
[switch]$Explicit         # Used to bypass automatic sequencing of init, workspace, <command> and will instead just run the provided command only
[string]$Version          # The version of Terraform to run, will automatically be downloaded if not already vendored
[switch]$CreateHardLink   # If present, Terraposh will automatically create a HardLink to the Terraform vendored binary
[string]$SignatureVerification # Required, Auto (default) or Off, see Signature verification
[switch]$SkipWorkspace    # If present, Terraposh will skip the creation of a Terraform workspace during the init, plan, apply, and destroy process
```
