# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-10-09

- Terraform archives are now verified against HashiCorp's published SHA-256 checksums before extraction; mismatches fail the command
- Downloads are restricted to `https://releases.hashicorp.com` with redirects refused
- `TerraformVersion` is validated as a semantic version, and a warning is shown when no version is pinned
- Archives and binaries cached by earlier versions are re-verified on first use
- Fixed the wrong architecture being downloaded on macOS/Linux (e.g. `amd64` on Apple Silicon); architecture is now detected from the OS on all platforms
- On Arm64 macOS and Windows, versions with no native build (e.g. Terraform < 1.0.2 on Apple Silicon) fall back to the `amd64` build under emulation, with a warning
- Added signature verification of Terraform releases: `terraform_<version>_SHA256SUMS` is verified with `gpgv` against HashiCorp's bundled release key on every OS
- Signature verification always runs: a missing `gpgv` fails the command (on Windows, if `gpgv` isn't on `PATH`, Git for Windows' or Gpg4win's `gpgv.exe` is found next to `git` or in their usual install locations)
- PowerShell 7.2 or later is now required
- Concurrent terraposh runs no longer interfere when downloading the same Terraform build; downloads and extraction are serialised per build with a lock file
- Added Pester tests and a GitHub Actions workflow running them on Linux, Windows and macOS
